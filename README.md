# Hello Web
A smaller website developed locally with hardcoding `HTML` and `CSS`, along with promises of `JS`.

## Structure
The user will land on `index.html`, which will have some minor information about the site, which some ~~are~~ *will be* further developed in the directories `about` and `contact`.

The **CSS** are stored in their seperate directory `css`, aswell as images in `img`, for easier usage from different parts of the site.

Other minor pages are to be determined.
